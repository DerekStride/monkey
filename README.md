# Monkey

[![Rust](https://github.com/DerekStride/writing-an-interpreter-in-rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DerekStride/writing-an-interpreter-in-rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

I'm following along the book ["Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball](https://interpreterbook.com/) and
implementing a toy language call Monkey.

I am using Rust instead of Go to help learn the language.
